## Introduction

This website is been built for Adriana Crafter, a local craft artist in Vilafranca del Penedes a small city near Barcelona in Spain. The primary focus of the site is to showcase and sell the dreamcatchers the artist does under request or through inspiration. The website should support the artist to expand her web-presence and the knowledge of her work beyond her local area. The artist currently works as a secondary teacher in a school and would like to increase her presence on the internet and to allow potential customers to see her craft work and potentially buy as well as networking with other artist that might show an interest.

#### **Scope**

In order to align the features defined in the strategy section, the scope was divided in two categories:

- **Content Requirements**

The user will be looking for:

- General information about the product.
- See what previous works the artist has done.
- Information about the artitst.
- A way to contact the artist directly.
- A way to personalise and purchase the product.
- New works/information about the artist and her work.

- **Functionality Requirements**

The user will be able to:

- Easily navigate through the site.
- Easily purchase the product.
- Easily ask any enquiries.

#### **Structure**

The website is been organised in a way the user can find the different sections in a strcutured but also relevant way. The results are as follows:

![Website Structure](assets/images/readme/structure.png)

#### **Skeleton**

How is the information represented and how does the user find such information:

- The Home page introduces the user to the meaning of dreamcatchers and their origins.
- The navigation bar is clear and simple for the user to understand what they will find in each page.
- The order page contains a form easy to understand and fill up to create orders.
- The gallery page contains all the main works from the artist and a quick description of them.
- The contact page is simple and quick to fill up.
- The footer contains icons representing the different social media platforms used by the artist.
- Wireframe mockups were created in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/4gvaJsObFnVYV8VWdcqqP2/Adriana-Crafter?node-id=0%3A1 "Link to Figma") to ensure the structure represented all the requirements described above (different versions were created).

#### **Surface**

The website needed a simple yet a fresh look that represents the personality of the artist but at the same time allowing the user to be able to easily navigate and find what they are looking for:

- The main targeted user as described above will expect simple, modern and clear features arranged in a way they can use and understand them intuitively.

- The colors used on the website is mainly the yellow already used on the logo created by the artist. This allows consistency as well.

- The fonts chosen were Sacramento for the logo (as already used in the logo designed by the artist) and Monsterrat for the rest of text, titles and buttons. This provided consistency as well. 

- The navigation is been designed in an efficient way at the same time as providing functionality.

## Features

This website is designed for potential customers in the local area of the artist who are looking to purchase a unique creation with a special meaning. The website also targets people interested on crafting and who wishes to purchase the artist work as well as networking.

### [Navigation Bar](index.html)

The Navigation Bar is featured in all the pages and allows the user to easily navigate and find what they are looking for. The menu is identical in all the pages and it includes links to the Home page, the Gallery, the Order form page and the Contact page.

This section is designed for easy use for the general public of all ages and conditions.

### [Landing Page Image](index.html)

The Landing Page image is designed for any user to be able understand what is the website about and what the artist does. It welcomes the user with one of the artist's works and 
introduces them to the content.

### [Home Section](index.html)

The Home section of the website is divided in two differents parts:

1. Part one:
The first part of the Home section includes a picture of a dreamcatcher and a little explanation of the meaning and why it is a special gift to make to the people you love, especially kids. It introduces the user to the origins, meaning, bad dreams and good dreams. This provides an extra value to the gift as it involves it is not only materialistic but a type of protection against nightmares.

2. Part two:
The second part of the Home section introduces to who the artist is and how she works. A video of how she works is attached and linked to her Youtube channel for the users to be able to see the tutorial or any other videos she might produce in the future.

### [Footer](index.html)

The footer is been kept as simple as possible with only the social media links to the artist´s different pages. It is featured at the bottom of all the pages for consistency and for the user to be able to access them quickly and easily.

### [Gallery](gallery.html)

The gallery page showcases all the orders and jobs already done by the artist. The user can see all the images in one same page and when clicking on a particular image this one opens in a new tab. Opening in a new tab offers the user a bigger view in more detail of the dreamcatchers and can inspire them when creating their own orders.

### [Create Your Order](order.html)

This page will allow the user to create their own order to the artist after getting inspiration from the gallery of images. It also provides price information and the options available as well as what to expect once the order is been sent to the artist. Note that because there is no back end related to the website, when sending the form there is no repsonse and the page refreshes itself.

### [Contact](contact.html)

The contact page allows the users to contact the artist with any question or requests they might have. This section is more versatile and allows the user to express themselves more directly and on a more personalised way. Note that because there is no back end related to the website when sending the form there is no repsonse and the page refreshes itself.

## Testing and Deployment

### Testing

General testing [video on Youtube (external link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ksSugzuVXw&list=PLbC7Bm_Rl5cs1FEHnFW7QnfA2k8t_7lSw&index=1 "Adriana Crafter general testing video"). The observations are as follows:

- Links in the navigation bar worked fine and opened the correct page.
- Links to social media platforms in all pages worked fine and opened in a separate tab.
- Hover elements on all pages worked correctly (navigations bar, social media links, forms buttons and images from the gallery).
- Video embeded from Youtube played fine and control buttons as well.
- In the order and contact forms the information couldn't be sent if all the required information was not entered or not entered correctly (such as name, surname, email, message, colors and size).
- The pages with a form refreshes themselves (no backend is present as explained above and this is expected to happen).
- Images from the gallery are opening in a separate tab.
- Navigation bar sticks to the top of the page when scrolling down.

Responsiveness testing [video on Youtube (external link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLc_xx3SDB0 "Adriana Crafter responsiveness testing video"). The observations are as follows:
- The website is responsive on medium screens, all the observations made above can be applied to this type of screens.
- For small screens the responsiveness was satisfactory as well but with small issues that are described below in the "Issues and BugS" section.

### Issues and Bugs

The issues stated below couldn't be fixed on time before project submission.

When testing the website the developer realised the following issues when checking the website on screens smaller than 700px:

1.  Problem: on the home page the What is a Dreamcatcher section the text is not aligned (it slightly floats to the right and to the left) and the space between the section title and the text is too big.

What is been tried to fix the issue: all the margins, paddings, widths and any option that might affect the positioning have been revised in all media queries and in the main CSS code with no luck. What the developer has learned from this issue is to keep the code as simple as possible in order to allow this developer, or any other developer that might need to, to fix the code in an easy and simple way. 

2. Problem: in the order page, in "STEP.3" the color options are not completely responsive and do not break down in pairs (the text "color" with the related drop down menu).

What is been tried to fix the issue: the developer has tried to use Flex to control the positioning of the boxes with no luck. Flex is a great tool to make the website responsive but it has its limitations, more experimenting using Flex will be unvaluable on using it in the future.
